# Kroeg
An [ActivityPub](http://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) implementation.

## Info
This server can be set up to create a work-in-progress (please don't run it in production just yet!) ActivityPub server, which is able to federate to other servers.
See [Kroeg.Server's README](Kroeg.Server/README.md) for more information. 

## License
Kroeg is licensed under the MIT license. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more information.

## Contact
For questions etc, I have set up an IRC channel at Freenode: `#kroeg`. I'm the only developer on here, so please don't get impatient!
