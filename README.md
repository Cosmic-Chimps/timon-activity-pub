# Kroeg
A reference implementation for [ActivityPub](http://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/).

## Info
This server can be set up to create a mostly-functional ActivityPub server, which is able to federate to other servers. It is mostly standalone, only requires a PostgreSQL server, and can be ran in load-balancing situations.
See [Kroeg.Server's README](Kroeg.Server/README.md) for more information. 

## License
Kroeg is licensed under the MIT license. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more information.

## Contact
For questions etc, I have set up an IRC channel at Freenode: `#kroeg`.
